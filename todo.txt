STUFF YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE HANDING IN THE PROJECT (other than needing to implement the needed functionality)
fix all the variable names and function names to fit camelCase
organize functions into modules to help with organization
represent each page as a folder 
    within that page folder:
        tf folder
            file for each word in the page and the contents is just the tf value for that word
            ex: 
            "apple.txt" : 0.5
        tf-idf folder   
            same concept
        incoming links folder
            file for each incominglink
        outgoing links folder
            file for each outgoinglink
        file
            PageRank value
    (We should be able to distinguish normal directories from page directories by if the directory contains a "PageRank.txt" file.)
